# CodeRift

🧠 CodeRift is a gamified platform to master Python, Bash, and Shell scripting through hands-on, story-driven challenges. Choose your world — Cyberpunk, Hacker Guild, Post-Apocalyptic, or AI Uprising — and level up your skills through real-world tasks.

## 🚀 MVP Goal
- Build challenge-based learning modules
- Integrate XP, badges, level map, Codex downloads
- Host fully on Vercel (frontend) + Firebase + Judge0 (backend-free MVP)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `/frontend`: React + Tailwind UI
- `/data/challenges`: JSON/Markdown-based problems
- `/data/codex`: Learning guides per concept
- `/codex-generator`: Convert Codex to PDF
